## Background

In Android development, performing tasks asynchronously is crucial to prevent blocking the UI thread and provide a smooth user experience. This project showcases two common methods of background threading: using Handler and Executor in the `master` branch, and utilizing Kotlin Coroutines in the `coroutine` branch.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Android Studio installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyBackgroundThread.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Choose the desired branch (`master` or `coroutine`) to explore the corresponding implementation.

## Usage

Each branch contains a simple demonstration of background threading:

- `master` branch demonstrates the usage of Handler and Executor to perform background tasks and update the UI.
- `coroutine` branch demonstrates the usage of Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming, simplifying background tasks.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your requirements.

## Branches

- **master**: Contains the implementation using Handler and Executor.
- **coroutine**: Contains the implementation using Kotlin Coroutines.
